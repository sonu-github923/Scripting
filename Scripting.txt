shell is a interface to interact with linux kernal

there are multiple interprator of linux shell like :- base,sh,fing other
base is more advance version where we can do lot more thing like useing loop , condition operator like used in java and other language. and 
sh is older interpretor we can not do lot more as we can in bash interpretor.

1> ls -> list all current file in folder
2> lst-ltr -> display all file with their permission like:- rwx r-read,w-write,x-execution
3> chmod +x -> give permision to file to be executable like:- if before chmod+x permission of file like rw-- only after this command it is rwx--


#!/bin/bash - tell operating system to use base interprator
#! - called shebang to notify interprator

command understanding ------------------------


#!/bin/bash  - shebang

#declaring varibale and make sure no space between before = and after = like a = 10 is wroung right is a=10

a=10
name="sonu"
age=27

echo "my name is $name and my age is $age and a value is $a" # we can print varibale value assign $ before varibale name in echo

hostnames=$(hostname) # hostname is prebuild command of linux if we want to assign value of than put command in $()
rename="kumar"
renamee=$(hostname)
